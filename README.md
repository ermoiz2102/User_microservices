# User_microservices
The user's contact-centric microservices constructed using Spring's RESTful API.
In this  project I have undertaken the creation of four distinct yet interconnected projects that collectively form a robust and versatile system. The foundation of this architecture lies in the 'user' project, which is carefully designed to manage and handle user-related functionalities. It encompasses user authentication, authorization and profile management, ensuring a secure and seamless experience for everyone interacting with the system.

Complementing the 'Users' project is the 'Contacts' module, a specialized microservice dedicated to organization and managing user contacts. The project enables users to manage their contacts effectively, providing functionality such as adding, modifying and categorizing contacts, thereby facilitating streamlined communication within the system.

To increase scalability and efficiency, I developed the 'EServer' project focusing on event driven architecture and real-time data processing. The project efficiently manages events across the system, enables seamless communication between different modules, ensures data consistency and enables instant updates across platforms.

Uniting these diverse yet interconnected projects is 'ApiGateway', a key component orchestrating seamless communication between various microservices. This gateway serves as a single entry point for external requests, intelligently routing them to relevant services while implementing security measures, load balancing and API composition, ensuring a unified and consistent user experience.

These projects, intricately woven together, represent a comprehensive system architecture intended to provide a robust, scalable and responsive platform for users. The thoughtful design and meticulous execution of each project fulfills specific functionalities while collectively creating a coherent ecosystem that seamlessly caters to diverse user needs.
